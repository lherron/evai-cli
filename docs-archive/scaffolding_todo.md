# Project Scaffolding Implementation

## Task Overview
We need to implement the basic project structure for the EVAI CLI tool, including:
- Creating the necessary Python package structure
- Setting up a basic CLI entry point
- Implementing basic testing

## Progress Tracking
- [X] **Create Project Structure**  
  - [X] Create `__init__.py` inside `evai/`.
  - [X] Create `cli.py` with a basic `main()` function.
- [X] **Command-Line Entry Point**  
  - [X] Decide on `argparse`, `click`, or similar.
  - [X] Implement minimal CLI that prints help/version info.
- [X] **Basic Testing**  
  - [X] Create `tests/` folder with a simple test (`test_cli.py`).
  - [X] Verify that invoking CLI with `python -m evai.cli` works.

## Implementation Summary
1. Created the basic directory structure for the EVAI CLI project
2. Created the `__init__.py` file in the evai package with version information
3. Created `cli.py` with a basic CLI implementation using argparse
4. Set up a basic test structure to verify the CLI works
5. Updated pyproject.toml to include pytest as a development dependency and configure the CLI entry point
6. Ran the tests to confirm everything is working as expected
7. Installed the package in development mode to use the `evai` command directly

## Next Steps
The Project Scaffolding tasks are now complete. The next step would be to implement the Command Directory & YAML Management functionality as outlined in the todo.md file.
