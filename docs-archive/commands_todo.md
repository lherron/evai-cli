# Commands Submodule Implementation Plan

## Task
Create a commands submodule under evai and move llmadd from cli.py into its own file.

## Steps
[X] Create the commands directory structure
[X] Create an __init__.py file in the commands directory
[X] Create a llmadd.py file in the commands directory
[X] Move the llmadd function from cli.py to llmadd.py
[X] Update imports in llmadd.py
[X] Update cli.py to import and use the new llmadd function
[X] Test the changes
[X] Fix name conflict between imported llmadd function and llmadd command function
[X] Verify the fix by testing the command with an actual argument

## Implementation Details
1. The commands directory was created at evai/commands/
2. The llmadd.py file contains the llmadd function from cli.py
3. The __init__.py file exposes the llmadd function
4. The cli.py file was updated to import the llmadd function from the commands submodule
5. Fixed a name conflict by importing the llmadd function as llmadd_command to avoid collision with the command function

## Testing
We tested the changes by running the CLI help command for the llmadd command:
```
python -m evai.cli command llmadd --help
```

The command works as expected, showing the help message for the llmadd command.

We also tested the command with an actual argument:
```
python -m evai.cli command llmadd test_command
```

The command successfully created a new command called "test_command" that subtracts two numbers.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed a name conflict issue where the imported llmadd function had the same name as the llmadd command function in cli.py, causing the CLI to misinterpret command arguments.

## Summary
We have successfully created a commands submodule and moved the llmadd function from cli.py to its own file. The CLI still works as expected, and the code is now better organized with the commands in their own submodule. We also fixed a name conflict issue that was causing the CLI to misinterpret command arguments.
