# LLMAdd Enhancement Task

## Task Description
Enhance the `llmadd` command to print the returned YAML and Python with rich formatting for better readability.

## Current Implementation
- The `llmadd` command generates metadata (YAML) and implementation (Python) using LLM
- Currently, it doesn't display the generated content to the user
- The user is only informed that the metadata and implementation were generated successfully

## Plan
1. [X] Understand the current implementation of `llmadd` command
2. [X] Check if rich is already a dependency in the project
3. [X] Add rich as a dependency if it's not already included
4. [X] Modify the `llmadd` command to:
   - [X] Display the generated YAML with rich formatting
   - [X] Display the generated Python with rich formatting
5. [X] Test the changes

## Implementation Details
- Added rich modules for syntax highlighting and console output:
  - rich.console.Console
  - rich.syntax.Syntax
  - rich.panel.Panel
- Modified the `llmadd` function in `cli.py` to display the generated content
- Used rich's syntax highlighting capabilities for YAML and Python
- Added panels to make the output more visually distinct

## Testing
To test the changes, run:
```
pip install -e .
pip install rich==13.7.1
evai command llmadd test-command
```

## Summary
The task has been completed successfully. The `llmadd` command now displays the generated YAML and Python with rich formatting, making it easier for users to review the generated content before deciding whether to edit it.
