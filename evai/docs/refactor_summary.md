# Refactoring Summary: `async_run_mcp_command`

## Overview
We've successfully refactored the large `async_run_mcp_command` function into smaller, more focused functions with clear responsibilities. This improves code readability, maintainability, and testability.

## Key Changes

### 1. Function Decomposition
- Split the monolithic function into 7 smaller, specialized functions:
  - `async_setup_mcp_session`: Handles MCP server connection setup
  - `get_anthropic_client`: Creates and returns the Anthropic client
  - `async_fetch_available_tools`: Gets and displays available tools
  - `async_call_claude_with_tools`: Makes API calls to Claude with error handling
  - `async_process_claude_response`: Processes Claude's response
  - `async_execute_tool_calls`: Executes tool calls and formats results
  - `async_run_conversation_loop`: Orchestrates the conversation flow

### 2. Improved Resource Management
- Properly handled context managers for MCP session
- Added explicit cleanup in finally blocks
- Simplified resource tracking with better variable names

### 3. Enhanced Configurability
- Added debug parameter to control debug output
- Added CLI option for debug mode
- Made debug output conditional

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Isolated error handling for different components
- Added more specific error messages
- Improved exception handling structure

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Added more detailed function documentation
- Improved type hints
- Reduced code duplication
- Made function responsibilities clearer

## Benefits
1. **Maintainability**: Smaller functions are easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Functions with clear inputs/outputs are easier to test
3. **Readability**: Code is more self-documenting with clear function names
4. **Flexibility**: Easier to add new features or modify existing ones
5. **Reliability**: Better resource management and error handling

## Verification
- Verified that the CLI parameters include the new debug option
- Confirmed that the refactored code maintains the same functionality
