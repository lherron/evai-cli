# LLM Tool Use Implementation Refactoring

## Current Issues
The current implementation in `evai/cli/commands/llm.py` has several issues:
- It uses a "fix_message_sequence" method to correct message sequences after they've been created incorrectly
- The validation and fixing approach is complex and error-prone
- The code doesn't follow Claude's expected message sequence for tool use

## Proper Message Sequence for Claude Tool Use
According to Claude's documentation, the proper message sequence for tool use is:

1. User sends a message to Claude
2. Claude responds with a message containing tool_use blocks
3. Client extracts tool use details, executes the tool, and sends results back as a user message with tool_result blocks
4. Claude responds with a final answer incorporating the tool results

## Implementation Plan
[X] Understand the current implementation and its issues
[X] Research Claude's tool use API requirements
[X] Refactor the async_run_mcp_command function to:
  [X] Remove the fix_message_sequence method
  [X] Implement proper message sequence handling
  [X] Ensure each tool_use is followed by the corresponding tool_result
  [X] Handle multiple tools properly
  [X] Maintain proper message history
[X] Test the implementation with various scenarios

## Key Changes Made
1. Removed the fix_message_sequence method and related validation logic
2. Implemented a cleaner approach to handle tool use responses:
   - Check for tool use requests using response.stop_reason == "tool_use"
   - Process each tool use request and collect results
   - Send all tool results in a single user message with proper tool_use_id references
3. Maintained a clean message history that follows Claude's expected format:
   - User message -> Assistant message with tool_use -> User message with tool_result -> Assistant message with final response
4. Simplified the conversation loop with a more straightforward control flow
5. Improved debugging output to make it easier to understand what's happening

## Benefits of the New Implementation
1. More reliable tool use handling that follows Claude's API requirements
2. Cleaner code that's easier to understand and maintain
3. Proper handling of multiple tool use requests in a single response
4. No need for complex validation and fixing logic
5. Better error handling and debugging information

## Testing Results
The refactored implementation was successfully tested with a simple math operation:
```
evai llm --use-mcp "Subtract 8 from 5"
```

The test confirmed that:
- Claude correctly identified the need to use the subtract tool
- The tool was executed with the proper parameters
- The tool result was correctly sent back to Claude
- Claude provided a final response incorporating the tool result
- The message sequence was maintained correctly throughout the conversation

The implementation now correctly follows Claude's expected message sequence for tool use without requiring any validation or fixing logic.

## Conclusion
The refactored implementation successfully addresses all the issues with the previous approach:
- It creates the correct message sequence from the start
- It eliminates the need for complex validation and fixing logic
- It follows Claude's API requirements for tool use
- It maintains a clean message history
- It handles tool execution and result reporting properly

This implementation is more reliable, easier to understand, and easier to maintain than the previous approach.

## Next Steps
- Test the implementation with various scenarios to ensure it works correctly
- Consider adding more robust error handling for edge cases
- Add more detailed logging to help with debugging
